# Paws-N-Pals üêæ

A full stack web application for prospective pet owners who want to find adoptable pets.

The inspiration behind this application stems from my strong love for all animals. Besides being a dog mom, there was a point in time where I spent four years of my time working on a farm. What made this opportunity special was the fact that I got to bond with the animals I worked with. Paws N Pals is a modern twist on your everyday dating app; rather than match individuals with other people, it matches people with adoptable animals(or "pals") within their area.
